        The German Shepherd is a breed of large-sized working dog that
        originated in Germany. The breed's officially recognized name is German
        Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as "GSD",
        and was also formerly known as the Alsatian and Alsatian Wolf Dog in
        Britain.

        The Greyhound is a very old European breed of dog, a sighthound which
        has been historically bred for coursing game and latterly Greyhound
        racing. Since the rise in large scale adoption of retired racing
        Greyhounds, particularly in North America from the end of the 20th
        century, it has seen a resurgence in popularity as a family pet.
